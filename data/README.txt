GoogleMatrixSample.csv are data pulled from the maps API for driving between some zip codes. Our pairs should be block groups to specific points instead of ZIP to ZIP. This will be the largest data set.
Df_BG_ODPair.csv are processed information from the PSRC survey. The google duration and trip_path_distances are done by PSRC. All values are averages for each origin/destination pair of blockgroups. This may be useful in tuning the basket algorithm or checking for reasonability.
df_Trip_Processed_Agg_Village_Origin are processed and aggregated information for some of the trip and household columns available in the PSRC survey. Iâ€™ve aggregated to Urban Village. We could aggregate to block group. However, most of this information is likely to be on the periphery of our project and we might not need infrastructure for this. You can see and download the full PSRC data here! https://www.psrc.org/household-travel-survey-program
we should keep lines to ~80 characters per line
