## Constants
- Column names should be SQL compatible.

 - Create new branches for each new feature. Branch names should be reflective of the work being done in the branch.
 - Branch naming convention: all lower case, separate words with dashes. For example: 'add-spiffy-feature'
 - Write detailed commit messages (https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)
